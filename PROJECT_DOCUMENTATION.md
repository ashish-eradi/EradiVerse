# Project Documentation: EradiVerse Dynamic Website

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a dynamic and scalable website for EradiVerse. The current static website will be rebuilt using a modern, full-stack JavaScript framework to enhance functionality, maintainability, and user experience.

The primary goal is to create a platform that is not only visually appealing and responsive but also allows for easy content management and data handling through a robust backend system.

## 2. Technology Stack

We will use the MERN stack, a popular and powerful combination of technologies for building modern web applications.

*   **Frontend: React**
    *   **Description:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create reusable UI components, leading to a more modular, scalable, and maintainable frontend codebase.
    *   **Styling:** We will continue to use **Tailwind CSS** for its utility-first approach, which enables rapid and consistent styling.

*   **Backend: Node.js & Express.js**
    *   **Description:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to build fast and scalable server-side applications. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    *   **Functionality:** The backend will handle all business logic, including API requests, form submissions, and user authentication.

*   **Database: MongoDB**
    *   **Description:** A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is known for its scalability and is a natural fit for JavaScript-based applications.
    *   **Usage:** It will be used to store all dynamic content, such as form submissions, user data, and content for the services and portfolio sections.

## 3. Key Features

The new dynamic website will include the following features:

*   **Dynamic Content Management:** Certain parts of the website, such as the services offered and portfolio items, will be managed through the database. This will allow for content updates without needing to change the code.

*   **Advanced Form Handling:**
    *   The "Contact Us" and "Get a Quote" forms will submit data to the backend.
    *   Submissions will be stored securely in the MongoDB database.
    *   Basic server-side validation will be implemented to ensure data integrity.

*   **User Authentication (Optional):**
    *   If desired, we can implement a full user authentication system.
    *   Users would be able to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
    *   This could be extended to allow for client-specific dashboards or content.

## 4. Project Structure

The project will be organized into two main directories: `client` for the React frontend and `server` for the Node.js backend.

## 5. Development Roadmap

The development will proceed in the following phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Backend Development**
    *   Set up the project structure with separate `client` and `server` directories.
    *   Initialize the Node.js server with Express.js.
    *   Design and create the MongoDB database schemas for forms and other dynamic content.
    *   Build the API endpoints for form submissions.

2.  **Phase 2: Frontend Development**
    *   Set up the React application.
    *   Convert the existing HTML pages into React components.
    *   Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
    *   Connect the frontend forms to the backend API endpoints.

3.  **Phase 3: Testing & Deployment**
    *   Thoroughly test the application, including form submissions and responsiveness.
    *   Prepare the application for deployment.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the plan to build a dynamic website for EradiVerse. Once you approve this plan, I will begin the development process.
